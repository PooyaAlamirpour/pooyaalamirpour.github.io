Iâ€™m Ankita, a graduate student at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore.

My on-going masters thesis investigates the synthesis of 3D worlds from monocular images. My work will look into how deep learning can be used with graphics to mimic urban scenes. My research interests revolve around integrating graphics with deep learning, data driven animation, rendering, and graphics in health care and education.

I am an experienced graphic designer. I've worked with several organizations and individuals to design logos, album art, brochures and templates. I spend my weekends baking for family and friends. I love indie music, a good paperback and going to the cinema. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would be interested in working together!
